I am currently a M.S. student at Zhejiang University (ZJU), China, advised by Prof. [Haoji Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huhaoji). Before that, I received my  B.E. Degree from Zhejiang University in 2016. I am interested in a variety of topics in computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p9S2Z3U7NhaGaJ2YKWU2wyKpV4-Bjl8_/view?usp=sharing).
# Now, I am visiting the [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/) at the University of California, Merced, working with Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/).
