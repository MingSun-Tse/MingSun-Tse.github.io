I am now a first-year PhD candidate at [SMILE lab](https://web.northeastern.edu/smilelab/) of Northeastern University (Boston, US), advised by Prof. [Yun (Raymond) Fu](http://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/). Before that, I received my M.S. and B.E. degrees from Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) in June 2019 and June 2016, supervised by Prof. [Haoji Hu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/huhaoji). During 2018 summer, I visited [VLLab](http://vllab.ucmerced.edu/) at University of California, Merced, working with Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/). I am interested in a variety of topics in computer vision and deep learning, especially deep model compression and interpretation. Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10iY-JBezaOVn4JLPGag95lRx-8MVuosX/view?usp=sharing).
